# Comparation of Smalltalk and Google Language

## Chapter 1: Introducing Smalltalk

The programming language Smalltalk is an open source object oriented programming language that was designed by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls and Adele Goldberg. Smalltalk was developed from 1970 to 1980 at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in California and released from 1980 to 1983. The development started with Smalltalk-71, went over Smalltalk-72, Smalltalk-74 and Smalltalk-76 to the nowadays konwn final and standard version Smalltalk-80.

In Smalltalk everything is an object. Even Strings, Integers, Booleans or a whole class is an own object. Every object can be inspected. An Integer object for example contains the self method that is comparable with the this constructor in java and an Integer object contains its value in binary, octal and hexadecimal too. In turn a String contains a list of characters. Further an Array in Smalltalk is designed to contain objects. For example this means that Integers, Strings and other types can be stored in one single Array.

Sending messages between objects is all about Smalltalk. A method can be called by sending a message. There are three types of messages you can do with Smalltalk. The first message is an unary message. An unary message contains only one word that will be sent to an object. For an example you can send the method today to the class date. The method today is the message the class date will receive. In the following illustration the message and the result of the message is shown.

```Smalltalk
Date today ---> 3 January 2020
```

In case of that if the class z does not contain the method, the message will be sent to the class above. If the top of all classes Object is reached and the method is still not existing, you will receive an error. But if the class Object contains the method, the method will be executed.

The second type of message is a binary message. Binary messages will be used to express logical, arithmetic and comparison operations. One example for a binary messages is b + c and this will return the sum of b and a. A binary message can be up to 2 characters and consist of these following special characters:

```
+ / \ * ~ < > = @ % | & ? ! , 
```

The keyword message is the third type of message you can do with Smalltalk. It calls a procedure with at least two parameters. An example could be the argument "30 between: 0 and: 50". This is another example for a keyword message: 

```Smalltalk
Array with: 1 with: 2 with: 3 with: 'last'. ---> #(1 2 3 'last')
```

As Christian Haider on the Night Of Knowledge in LÃ¼beck 2017 said. Smalltalk is called Smalltalk, because the syntax should be that easy to read like an English sentence. This is the reason why arguments in Smalltalk end with an dot, not with a semicolon. Additionally, Christian Haider said, Smalltalk contains only six words that are already defined at  the beginning and do not need to be defined. These words are true, false, nil, super, thisContext and self. This means that everything else, even do or if loops need to be defined by the user.

## Chapter 2: Using grammar and parsers in Smalltalk
The easiest way to get a parser run is to implement the PetitParser.  PetitParser is a framework developed for parsing or for writing parsers. It can be implemented in various Smalltalk platforms. In this study work every Smalltalk code is written in the Pharo integrated development environments.  

After the PetitParser is implemented, it is easy to define an own grammar in Smalltalk. PetitParser includes some terminal parsers lik #digit, #any or #word for example. Following is a grammar with its rule that it begins with an digit and will be followed by at least one character.

```Smalltalk
firstGrammer := #digit asParser , #any asParser plus.
```

The first input returns false, because of corse there is no digit at 0 and the following is empty.

```Smalltalk
firstGrammer matches: '@'.          --> false
```

The second one is false too, because there is a character at 1, but still no digit at 0.

```Smalltalk
firstGrammer matches: '@x.          --> false
```

The third got a digit first of all, but got no further character after the digit.

```Smalltalk
firstGrammer matches: '1'.          --> false
```

The last returns true because is has got an digit at first followed by at least one character.

```Smalltalk
firstGrammer matches: '9@test'.     --> true
```
For doing this simple code, its not even needed to create a class. This means that this can be done in the Pharo Playground. The Pharo Playground equals an input and output console. These grammar will now be advanced and more difficult.

The following grammar is expressing natural and exponential numbers in positiv and negativ. 

```Smalltalk
expoNumber :=   $- asParser optional, #digit asParser plus, ($. asParser, #digit asParser plus, 
                ($e asParser / $E asParser, ($- asParser / $+ asParser) optional, #digit asParser plus) optional) optional.
```
For better legibility there is the same code summed up in the following box.

```Smalltalk
naturalNumber := #digit asParser plus.
expo := ($e asParser / $E asParser), ($- asParser / $+ asParser) optional, naturalNumber.

expoNumber := $- asParser optional, naturalNumber, ($. asParser, naturalNumber, expo optional) optional.
```
The first two input don't match the grammar. The first one contains letter and the second one starts with two hyphen. The program will return false.

```Smalltalk
expoNumber := 'asdf'            --> false
expoNumber := '--131'           --> false
```

The following inputs match the grammar, so it will return right.

```Smalltalk
expoNumber := '1909'            --> true
expoNumber := '-1909'           --> true
expoNumber := '-3.14E-17'       --> true
expoNumber := '3.14e+19'        --> true
```

## Chapter 3: Defining an own grammar and parser
In this chapter a own grammar will be defined, it will be parsed and tested. 

The following parse tree will be implemented in Smalltalk.

image::screenshots\AST.png[GitHub mascot]

This pars tree shows that the term is either a minus or a pro. A pro is an multiplication or an var. The var is a bracket or a num. This means that a valid input has to start with an open bracket ( or with an num. If the input starts with an num, the next iteration has to be an open bracket or an num again. After an open bracket there has to be a term. A term has to start with an num at least. After the num the bracket can be closed again. This iteration is going as long as every character of the term went through this grammar. If all characters are part of the grammar, the return value of the parser will be true. If any character is not part of the grammar or the input are in the grammar but in an wrong order, the return value is automatically false. 
 
At first it is needed to create a new Subclass to PPCompositeParser. The subclass is called CoPGrammer and will created automatically by Pharo like this.

```Smalltalk
PPCompositeParser subclass: #CoPGrammer
    instanceVariableNames: ''
    classVariableNames: ''
    package: 'PetitParser-Tools'
```

The first step is to define the method num that shows the grammar for an integer called here num. This method will be defined as followed.

```Smalltalk
num 
^ #digit asParser plus flatten trim ==> [ :str | str asNumber ]
```

The next step is to define more expression grammar parsers. The following grammar parsers that are needed, called subt for subtract, term, mul for multiplication, brackets, num for number, pro for production and var for variables. 

But before these methods the start method should be defined that CoPGrammer inherited from PPCompositeParser and needs to be overridden. The start method looks like this.

```Smalltalk
start 
^ term end
```

The method term just defines that a term can be a subt character or a pro. For now it is fictitious a pro.

```Smalltalk
term 
^ subt / pro 
```

The method pro defines if the pro is a mul or a var character. In this fictitious example, the pro is a var.

```Smalltalk
pro 
^ mul / var 
```

The method var defines if the var character is an opening bracket or a num. If it is neither an opening bracket nor a num, the parser will return false. 

```Smalltalk
var 
^ brackets / num
```

In case that the var is an opening bracket, the bracket will be called and is defined as follows.

```Smalltalk
brackets 
^ $( asParser trim, term, $) asParser trim
```

If the var is not a opening bracket, but a num, the num parser will be called and the num parser method is defined like this.

```Smalltalk
num 
^ #digit asParser plus flatten trim ==> [ :str | str asNumber ]
```

The subt method will be called if the term is not a pro. If the term is not a subt character neither, the parser will return false.

```Smalltalk
subt 
^ prod, $- asParser trim, term
```

The mul method will be called, if a pro is not a var. In case that the pro is not a mul neither the parser will return false.

```Smalltalk
mul 
^ var, $* asParser trim, pro
```

After every single method that is finished, Pharo asks to create an instance variable. This needs to be done and after Pharo has created them, the class CoPGrammer looks like this.

```Smalltalk
PPCompositeParser subclass: #CoPGrammer
    instanceVariableNames: 'subt term mul var brackets num pro'
    classVariableNames: ''
    package: 'PetitParser-Tools'
```

After the methods are defined and the main code is written, it is required to write test methods.   
But at first it is required to add a new subclass. The class is named CoPGrammerTest and is the subclass of PPCompositeParserTest. The class looks like.

```Smalltalk
PPCompositeParserTest subclass: #CoPGrammerTest
    instanceVariableNames: ''
    classVariableNames: ''
    package: 'PetitParser-Tools'
```

In this step the test class has to be referred to the class where the methods belong to.

```Smalltalk
parserClass
^ CoPGrammer
```

The test method testMul checks if the input contains an multiplication character and proceeds successful and returns true if the character is an multiplication character.

```Smalltalk
testMul 
self parse: '17*39' rule: #mul.
```

The second test method is testNum. This method checks, if the input contains an digit. If the character is an digit, the return value is true else it is false.

```Smalltalk
testNum
self parse: '1909' rule: #num.
```
The testSubt method is testing, if the input contains a subtraction character. In that case it will return true. Else the return value is false.

```Smalltalk
testSubt 
self parse: '999-55' rule: #subt.

openBracketTest is the test method for an opening bracket and checks if the input contains an opening bracket.

```Smalltalk
openBracketTest
self parse: '4*(4' rule: #brackets.
```

closeBracketTest ist he test method for a closing bracket. This method checks, if the input contains a closing bracket.

```Smalltalk
closeBracketTest
self parse: '4*4)' rule: #brackets.
```

As already known from the CoPGrammer-class, Pharo is creating the instanceVariableNames to the class PPCompositeParserTest. The class looks like this now.

```Smalltalk
PPCompositeParserTest subclass: #CoPGrammerTest
	instanceVariableNames: 'testBrackets testMul testNum testPro testSubt testTerm testVar'
	classVariableNames: ''
	package: 'PetitTests-Core'
```

 From now the parser can be used in the playground of Pharo. At first create a new Instance of the class CoPGrammer. Here are a few examples that are true and false.

```Smalltalk
parser := CoPGrammer new.

parser matches: '((2-2)*(2-2)*(5-1))'   --> true
parser matches: '(100-2222):3'          --> false
parser matches: '3*(2-3)'               --> true
parser matches: '3(3):(1)'              --> false
```

## Chapter 4: Comparing Smalltalk with Google Language
This chapter is about the characteristics and, strength or advantages and application areas of the programming languages Smalltalk and Google Language. As already mentioned in the introduction, the final version of Smalltalk was released in 1980 whereas Golang was released 2009. 

Smalltalk is a cross-platform operating system and the Google Language is operating on DragonFly BSD, FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Plan 9, Solaris and of corse on Windows.

Correspondingly Smalltalk has many languages that it influences and the Google Langauge. The languages, Smalltalk influences, are AppleScript, Common Lisp Object System, Dart, Dylan, Erlang, Etoys, Go, Groovy, Io, Ioke, Java, Lasso, Logtalk, Newspeak, NewtonScript, Object REXX, Objective-C, PHP 5, Python, Raku, Ruby, Scala, Scratch andSelf. In comparison the Google Language just influences in one language. This language is called Crystal that appeared in 2014.

Both languages are influenced by a couple of languages. Smalltalk is influenced by Lisp, Simula, Euler, IMP, Planner, Logo, Sketchpad, ARPAnet, Burroughs, B5000, cell (biology). The Google Language however is influenced by Alef, APL, BCPL, C, CSP, Limbo, Modula, Newsqueak, Oberon, occam, Pascal and even by Smalltalk.

While Smalltalk is object-oriented only, the Google Language is tracking multi paradigm. Next to the concurrent programming, Google Language is supporting and offering functional, imperative and object oriented paradigm. 

While Smalltalk has a dynamic and the Google Language got an Inferred, static and structural typing discipline, both have a strong typing discipline. Visa versa this means that the easier the syntax and all the better the legibility of the code is the more it can prevent the developer from getting compiling problems or errors.

Due to the age and limited usage, example given just around 1.500 questions were asked on the website StackOverflow, there is a much smaller community support for the programming language Smalltalk. In comparison, Google Language has around 42.000 questions asked on StackOverflow. The search results of Google are much higher and there are much more tutorial videos uploaded on YouTube. Furthermore, as the name implies, Google Language is supported by Google that attracts more attention. That makes the Google Language much more popular than Smalltalk. Due to this popularity of the Google Language learning it is easier than learning Smalltalk, although the syntax of Smalltalk is very simple.

But the advantages of Smalltalk are not insignificant. The syntax of Smalltalk is limited to the bare minimum and the Smalltalk compiler has just around 10 different types of nodes to guarantee the support oft he language. How many nodes exactly are given, depends on the implementation details. Beside the elegant and already mentioned easy syntax there are many integrated development environments to learn the language. It is even possible to learn Smalltalk via internet browser. Amber is an example for learning Smalltalk in the internet. Another advantage of Smalltalk is the possibility to modify the system while it is running. And it contains all classes, all objects and their source code plus all at the moment executed threads. This means that while working in the smalltalk system, the code is installed and compiled into the running system. 

The application area of Smalltalk was famous. The general user interface of the Macintosh that was released by Apple in 1984, was written in Smalltalk. Another big project that was implemented via Smalltalk was The Analyst in the early 80s. This project was commissioned by the CIA and was used to store data. This program was similar to Microsoft Excel and invented to analyse data that the CIA collected.

The Google Language has in return team working behind the scene to improve the language constantly. Since the Go 1 release in March 2012, the Google Language has got 12 Updates in 7 years. That are almost 2 Updates per year. The Google Language is designed by a team with many contributors to work in teams with many contributors. According to a survey on slant.co, the Google Language is the best programming language to write compilers. Beside the StackOverflow community, the Google Language is even popular on social networks like Twitter, present on networks like Reddit and even has its own Wikipedia. Furthermore it is possible to assign more than one variable per line in Google Language. This means that temporary variables are not needed anymore. 

The application area of the Google Language is very broad. It is very suitable for the realization of Microservices. Further the Google Language is according to slant.co very good in concurrent languages, compiling programming, writing command line utilities, one of the best for general-purpose programming, the 4th of the most important web development languages, also 4th of learning backend development and in further many more categories places in the top 10. 

## Chapter 5: Conclusion
Like always everywhere, it depends on your own preferences and interests. If I had to choose, I personally would prefer to jump into Smalltalk deeper, because the overlay looks more familiar to me, it is clearer, the syntax was more legible and the integrated development environment was very handsome. On the other side the Google Language is more supported and it is better for its appropriated areas like compiler- or system development. But all in all I think, that in my opinion three months are not enough to judge about these two programming languages and it is not possible to rate it objectively.
